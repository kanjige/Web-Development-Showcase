            <section class="float_description">

This article is guaranteed to find you your inner Confucius, so long as you follow it step by step.</p>

                    <h2>Step 1: Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Meditation can help improve one’s mindset and how they approach aspects of their lives. It is a simple and free method that would help one achieve their inner Confucius, along with providing additional physical and mental health benefits. By allocating even 5-10 minutes a day to meditation, one would be able to find inner peace and their own Confucius. </p>

                    <h2>Step 2: Read About Confucius</h2>
                    <p >To further understand one’s inner Confucius, they must first understand their outer Confucius- otherwise known as Confucius himself. To know more about his life and philosophies, reading is a cost effective, accessible way to learn more about the Chinese philosopher. The best text to start off with is The Analects, an ancient Chinese text traditionally believed to be compiled by Confucius' followers.</p>

                    <h2>Step 3: Adopt Confucius' Philosophies</h2>
                    <p>To further deepen your inner Confucius, naturally, you can not only deepen your understanding of Confucius’ philosophies, but make them your own as well. By living based of Confucius’ ideals, it is the most effective way to awaken that inner Confucius for its cost.</p>

                <section class="box_steps">
                    <h2>Step 4: Adopt Someone With Confucius' Philosophies</h2>
                    <p>Some people are naturally unable to adopt Confucius’ philosophies, and that’s okay; there’s still options out there if you still desire to realize your inner Confucius. If you can’t naturally conceive your own inner Confucius, adopting someone that does have an inner Confucius will let you live vicariously through them, finding your own inner Confucius by finding someone that found theirs.</p>

                <section class="box_steps">
                    <h2>Step 5: Adopt Someone and Force Them to Adopt Confucius' Philosphies</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes it might be hard to find someone who already has Confucius’ philosophies. As generations pass, the amount of people that bother to find their inner Confucius has statistically fallen, but that doesn’t mean you’re out of options. This method, commonly known as indoctrination, involves adopting someone (preferably a young, impressionable child), and forcing them to find their own inner Confucius, as you couldn’t find yours yourself.</p>

                <section class="box_steps">
                    <h2>Step 6: Adopt Confucius</h2>
                    <p>As a worst case scenario, you always have the option to adopt Confucius himself. Methods such as necromancy, resurrection, or even finding Confucius’ reincarnation has proven to be suitable methods in the past. </p>
