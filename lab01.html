                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Raised in a relatively small house in a family of four, my younger years outside of school, extracurriculars, and the Sunday swimming classes I dreaded every week was occupied with one thing in mind: Pokemon. Watching the show, collecting the cards, and playing the same game (Platinum) multiple times naturally led to me wanting to help develop the next game, bringing me down a pipeline of learning about game development and later in my life, programming, leading to me making this website right now. </p>
                <p>Since then, I’ve gained interests in UX/UI design, psychology and human interaction, web development and software development as a whole.</p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>Ever since learning classical instruments in Grade 7 music class and band, I’ve had a strong interest in playing and creating music (albeit very poorly). Instrument wise, I can play the piano and flute to a… passable degree and try to practice the former when I have free time. I aim to one day make a song that I’m proud of and willing to share to people. </p>
                    <p>Listening wise, I find myself listening to the same artists on loop a bit too much (people that know me personally may call me deranged for it). Currently, those artists include <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/58oPVy7oihAEXE0Ott6JOf">Eve</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6HvZYsbFfjnjFrWF950C9d">NewJeans</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6WmXWHmfBMhupyIs8MSqtu">Natori</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Cd373x8qzC7SNUg5IToqp">BoyWithUke</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Reading/Writing</h3>
                    <p>Another prevelant hobby I picked up is analyzing and discussing stories, primarily the characters and themes within those stories. I’ve been known to be a bit too analytical over stories I care a lot about, and find myself theorizing and psychoanalyzing characters more than once for my own curiosity. I currently am also writing a story on and off with my random bursts of inspiration.</p>

                    <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                    <p>Other things I find fun is gaming, drawing, and just spending time with friends and family. I also have dreams of owning a coffee shop one day (I don’t drink coffee).</p>
